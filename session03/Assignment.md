## Displaying Kafka Monitoring Data in Grafana
In this exercise you shall set up an environment, where you are able to monitor a kafka instance and display the monitoring data in Grafana.  It is expected that all of you will be able to depict the monitoring data of their instance within Grafana.

Before you start with this exercise make sure that no container instances are up and running. You may use `docker kill zookeeper kafka kakfa-manager`  followed by `docker rm zookeeper kafka and kakfa-manager` to clean your working environment.
